# How to test your app?

## Introduction

Hey there 👋🏼 ! Ready to dive into the exciting world of `software testing`?

 Imagine you're a software developer working on a new mobile app designed to simplify personal finance management. As you delve into the project, you realize the critical role of testing in ensuring the app's success.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Exploring Key Testing Types

### Functional Testing: Your First Step

Functional testing is like checking that every button on a remote control does what it's supposed to. It ensures software features work smoothly, making users' lives easier.

### Non-Functional Testing: Digging Deeper

Non-functional testing focuses on the software's performance, security, and usability—like making sure a car not only drives but also has airbags and a comfy seat.

- **Performance Testing:** Checking how fast the software runs, just like timing a race.
- **Security Testing:** Keeping hackers at bay by fortifying software defenses.
- **Usability Testing:** Ensuring the software is easy to use, like a well-designed playground.


### Regression Testing

Despite your best efforts, you know that bugs can still creep into the code. That's where Regression Testing comes in handy—it's like checking your homework to make sure you didn't miss any steps. By retesting previously working features after each change, you ensure the app remains stable and bug-free.

### Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing is the final approval before the big reveal. It's when we make sure the software meets users' needs and expectations, like a chef tasting their masterpiece before serving it to guests.

### 🧑‍🔬 Other Testing Techniques for Crafting a Digital Masterpiece

As you dive deeper into testing, you'll explore `Integration Testing`, `System Testing`, and `Monkey Testing`.

 - `Integration Testing`: Just as in your finance management app, Integration Testing ensures that different modules such as income tracking, expense management, and budgeting work seamlessly together. For instance, you want to ensure that when a user adds a new expense, it correctly reflects in their overall budget and financial reports.
  
  - `System Testing`: You need System Testing to assess the entire app's functionality. In your finance management app, System Testing ensures that not only individual features like transaction tracking or budget forecasting work as intended, but also that they integrate harmoniously with each other to provide a cohesive user experience.
  
  - `Monkey Testing`: It's litterally like the name says, a monkey, testing your app and doing all kind of crazy stuff. It involves random and unexpected inputs to stress-test the application, simulating how a monkey might interact with it.

### 🎉 Hurray! You are all set!

Now you're all set! You'll pick the right testing methods for each development stage. Remember, not every test is needed for every project or stage. You'll learn and adjust as you go—it's a journey with plenty of room for improvement!
